This project aimed to apply data visualization and analytical skills to a real-world context. Over a 16-day period, I collected and analyzed personal sleep pattern data to identify trends and insights. Using statistical techniques, including hypothesis testing, I evaluated whether the observed sleep patterns align with recommended sleep guidelines for Americans. The project demonstrates proficiency in data collection, exploratory analysis, hypothesis formulation, and visual storytelling.
